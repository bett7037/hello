<h1>HELLO!! MY FIRST INTERACTION WITH GIT</h1>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development to manage and track changes in source code. It allows developers to work collaboratively on projects, keeping a history of every code modification, enabling easy branching for different features, and facilitating code merging. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git, serving as a centralized repository hosting service. It enhances collaboration by providing features like pull requests, issue tracking, and wikis, making it an invaluable resource for software teams and open-source communities. Together, Git and GitHub have revolutionized the way developers collaborate, ensuring code integrity and streamlining the development process.</p>
